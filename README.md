# Freelancer's Oasis
A website dedicated to listing Denver-based coffee shops and their WIFI availability. Infinitely customizable to any city, the script uses Flask and WTForms to write data to a .csv file that is referenced when rendering the home page and then formats that data to the prescibed template. 

Templates pulled from HTML5UP.net

Source photos are screen shots taken by yours truly.

Coffee logo is an .svg file created by myself in Adobe Illustrator. As always, steal or destroy at your leisure!
